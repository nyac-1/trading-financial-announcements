# Trading based on Financial Anouncements
### _NLP in finance_


The project has three phases: data collection, NLP model, and trading based on the generated model. For this project the firms from the Singapore Exchange will be used which will cover various asset classes. Novelty is in structuring a NLP model to generate alpha signals. Still working on how to structure the NLP model. The trading system will be a fairly simple long short trade, which will be highly dependent on how the NLP model quantifies information. The trading system's risk metrics will be presented.
